  <p>
    <Link external class="link" href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</Link> uses "keys" instead of passwords to identify users.
    This allows users to own their social identity instead of renting it from a tech company, and can bring it with them
    from app to app.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good way to manage your keys is to use a remote signing application. These apps can hold your keys and log you in
    remotely to as many applications as you like, without risking loss or theft of your keys.
  </p>
  <p>
    One way to log in with a remote signer is using a "bunker link" which is more secure and decentralized than other
    solutions. Check your signer for a link beginning with "bunker://", copy it into {PLATFORM_NAME}, and you should be
    good to go!
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't have a signer yet, <Link external class="link" href="https://nsec.app/">nsec.app</Link>
    is a great way to get started. You can find more signers on <Link
      external
      class="link"
      href="https://nostrapps.com#signers">nostrapps.com</Link
    >.
