    {PLATFORM_NAME} hosts spaces on the <Link external href="https://nostr.com/" class="underline">Nostr protocol</Link
    >. Nostr uses "relays" to host data, which are special-purpose servers that speak nostr's language. This means that
    anyone can host their own data, making the web more decentralized and resilient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Different relays have different policies for access control and content retention. Be sure to double check that you
    have access to the relays you try to use by visiting their website.
